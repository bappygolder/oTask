## How to use oTask
Each sessions you use on oTask is called a **Sprint**. The time you choose to finish your sprint is called **sprint end time or SET**. 

1. Decide the **sprint end time (SET)** by when you want to finish you tasks. It could be the end of the work day, the next 2 hours, just before going to sleep or just a certain time (i.e: 5pm). You are in full control.
2. Start/Visit [oTask](http://bappygolder.github.io/oTask/Project-Source/#/taskView).
3. List the tasks you want to finish by the **sprint end time (SET)**. Keep listing them as you remember or from your ToDo list, email from elsewhere. The tasks you remember are often the most important, try to get them in the list first. Try to keep your list as minimal as possible. We recommend listing 5 tasks or less for a sprint at a time.
4. Now look at your list and decide which item is the most important. Start it, finish it, cross it off and move on to the next most important item.
5. Try to do as much as you can by your SET. Once you've reached your SET take a break or do something else before restarting another sprint.

This is just one way to use oTask. The possibilities are endless. Feel free to use it whatever way you like.

## oTask Philosophy
**oTask** borrows from Agile software development philosophy and applies it to our day to day task management. You can supercharges your daily task management using oTask. Your day can become a sprint, your evening until bed time can be another sprint. oTask keeps you focused and helps you see easily things you need to focus on and complete. You try to do what is possible within a sprint. These are things you want to get done. Anything you can't do in one sprint gets removed and then gets added to the next sprint. New sprints start as blank list. Unlike traditional ToDo lists you can't save your tasks. In the morning or in the beginning of the sprint you open **oTask**, you create your sprint with what you want/need to do for that specific sprint. You can bring in tasks from other task list to **oTask** at the beginning of the sprint as well.

The idea is if something is important enough you will remember it. Also the process of writing a task at the beginning of the sprint gets your brain into gear to complete that task. You can use **oTask** along with other todo lists and task management systems to get things done faster and more efficiently.

1. Create a fork (if you don't already have one)
2. [Choose the issue](https://github.com/bappygolder/oTask/issues) you want to work on.
3. If you are working on a old fork make sure it is up to date with **our master** branch. 
3. Make your feature branch. (*Note:* All branches are named after the issue number prefixed with **OT**. For example: **OT1**, **OT5**, **OT32** etc.)
4. Let others know you are working on this issue by making a comment on the issue page.
5. Subscribe to the issue to see any future updates. 
6. Start working on the feature brunch until you get things working. 
7. Once everything is working perfectly within your **forked version** of the code send a final pull request to us.
8. Wait till one of us can get back to you. We'll review the code together with you before merging. 

Don't forget to ask if you need any help. Thank you in advance and happy coding :+1:
